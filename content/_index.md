# Hello, I'm Ceyhun Atage√ß

## I'm a self taught frontend developer.

I love wandering in dungeons of CSS and look for hidden treasure chests. I always try to create new learning models outside of traditional learning techniques.

I enjoy turning theoretical concepts into small visual bits.

I also love running and doing push-ups.
